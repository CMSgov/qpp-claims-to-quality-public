# Contributing

## Developing in the Open

Developing in the open creates a healthier working environment, a more collaborative process, and just better software.

We welcome contributions.

The CMS-C2Q team handles development of this project in the open. As such, the development team uses GitHub to keep track of project development. We may not accept contributions if they introduce operational complexity or don't align with the goals of the project. All contributions are subject to the license and in no way imply compensation for contributions.

Contributions that include appropriate unit tests are more likely to be accepted by the CMS-C2Q team.

## Feedback

To provide feedback on the code please create an issue on GitHub.
For other issues please refer to the note in [README](README.md)

## How to Contribute

To contribute simply create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch to work on (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your work (we like commits that explain your thought process)
4. Submit a pull request
5. If there is an issue associated with your pull request link that issue

For documentation changes you can edit the file directly on GitHub and select the option to create a pull request with your own branch.

## Tests and Continuous Integration

All pull requests must pass our continuous integration (CI) tests in order to be accepted.
